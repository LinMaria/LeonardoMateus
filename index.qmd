::: {#about-block}
## Welcome!

I am a civil Engineer with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Geotechnical Engineering, specializing in numerical modeling, data processing, and programming for seismic hazards and risks. Passionate about exploring innovative methodologies to enhance data analysis and scientific approaches for addressing seismic hazards. Strong interest in seismic hazard, dynamic response, rock mechanics and hydromechanics in particular stress characterization.  

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:lsmateusb@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.

# Research scope

My primary research project focused on using finite element analysis to simulate seismic signal propagation within a sedimentary basin model, emphasizing the geological complexity of Tunja and Pereira basins in Colombia. This work involved constructing detailed numerical models, utilizing GiD for mesh generation, Quad4M for seismic wave simulation, and Python for data analysis. 

In an accompanying animation, I illustrate the propagation of an SH wave pulse through the Tunja basin, capturing its interaction with the soil's nonlinear behavior.
