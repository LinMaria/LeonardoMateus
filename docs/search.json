    "title": "Topographic Effect",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Numerous studies have identified that topography significantly influences the amplification of seismic waves, with amplifications occurring on convex forms such as hills and deamplification on concave geoforms such as valleys and canyons (Rai, 2015)\nCalibrating the model is essential for ensuring its reliability. A close correspondence between the modeled results and actual earthquake measurements validates the model’s accuracy (@#fig-stations). Below is another numerical model from Pereira, Colombia, where the impact of topography on amplification is clearly visible. Most importantly, this example underscores the precision of the two-dimensional model in capturing these effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Amplification functions for three stations located at three key locations along the Pereira basin profile.\n\n\n\nPERC1, PERC2, and PERC3 are accelerometer stations located on varying topographies. Each figure presented includes four lines representing different aspects of seismic data analysis:\n\nReg-Boca-Roca (gray line) illustrates the actual signal recorded over rock ( Vs &gt; 760 m/s), which was used as the input signal\nMod NL 1D (red line) illustrates the response spectrum generated by a one-dimensional model.\nMod 2D (green line) illustrates the response spectrum generated by a two-dimensional model.\nRecord (black line) illustrates the response spectrum from a real earthquake event\n\nI conducted several two-dimensional models across a range of intensities, selecting multiple points on the surface to compute curvature and slope from a digital elevation model. These calculations were then correlated with amplifications, enabling me to establish functional relationships. These relationships illustrate how terrain characteristics influence amplification effects for specific spectral periods (PGA, 0.2 s, 1.0 s) (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Correlation between curvature - slope with amplification for different spectral periods.\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3, we observe transfer functions corresponding to each combination of slope and curvature. It’s evident that a curvature of zero results in an amplification equal to zero. Positive curvatures represent crests, leading to amplifications, while negative curvatures are indicative of valleys, resulting in deamplifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Amplification functions due to the topographic effect.\n\n\n\nTo effectively integrate the amplification function into building codes, thereby enhancing seismic risk assessment and informing policy development, the calculated amplification (as shown in Figure 3) across various curvature-slope combinations is spatially mapped out in Figure 4 for a fixed spectral period. This approach allows for a detailed visualization of how topographic features influence seismic amplification, offering valuable insights into the spatial variability of seismic risk. By delineating areas of high amplification, this spatialization aids in the targeted refinement of building codes, ensuring that structures are designed with an optimal level of resilience against seismic forces specific to their topographic setting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Spatial distribution of the calculated topographic amplification."

    "title": "Basin effect",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The primary research focus was integrating models into seismic hazard, by using numerical simulations to account for site-specific effects. It was addressed by conducting two-dimensional simulations that analyzed the propagation of seismic waves through the ground and incorporating a non-linear constitutive model into QUAD4M, a FORTRAN software developed by researchers at the University of California, Davis.\nAccording to Ayoubi et al. (2020), the basin effect refers to the amplifications resulting from seismic waves trapped in soft sedimentary deposits located above a concave-shaped rock base. This condition causes significant changes in the amplitude, duration, and frequency of seismic signals. This behavior has been observed and has played a significant role in various earthquakes (Campillo et al., 1989; Pitarka et al., 1996; Hallier et al., 2008; Asimaki et al., 2015; Makra et al., 2021).\nIso-accelerations\nThe results of our work are twofold: On Figure 1 (a), we highlight the sedimentary basin in gray, underscoring its complex structure and geological significance. On Figure 1 (b), we present iso-acceleration contours from our simulations, which identify areas within the basin at increased risk of seismic activity. This methodology not only advances our understanding of seismic wave behavior through complex geological formations but also aids in the precise identification of high-risk zones, contributing crucial data for seismic risk mitigation and urban planning in Tunja.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Geological profile of the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Iso-aceleration values in the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Modeling results for the Tunja basin\n\n\n\nIn our study, we’ve identified significant variations in the duration, amplitude, and frequency of seismic waves at nodes overlying sedimentary basins and topographic features, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Surface-Viewed Waveform Shapes Derived from Modeling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Figure 3 (a) and Figure 3 (b) offer a detailed visualization through colormaps of amplification versus structural period, utilizing a color spectrum where more intense shades of blue signify higher amplifications, contrasting sharply with yellows that indicate lower amplifications. On the left, we observe the amplification outcomes derived from a one-dimensional model, providing a foundational yet simplified understanding of seismic wave amplifications across the basin. In Figure 3 (a), the amplifications depicted are the result of employing more complex two-dimensional models, offering a nuanced and comprehensive portrayal of seismic behavior.\nKey observations from these models include:\n\nProminent Amplification in Basin’s Deepest Zones: Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models converge on the insight that the most significant amplifications are observed near the deepest zones of the basin. This correlation underscores the critical role of basin depth in influencing seismic wave amplification, a vital consideration for seismic risk assessment.\nOne-Dimensional Model Limitations: The one-dimensional model, while valuable for initial analyses, exhibits inherent limitations in its capacity to fully replicate the intricate features of the basin’s geology. This simplification results in a less accurate representation of how seismic waves interact with the basin’s complex structure.\nTwo-Dimensional Model’s Detailed Capture: In contrast, the two-dimensional model demonstrates a superior ability to accurately model and reflect the basin’s detailed geological features. This model successfully captures variations in seismic behavior that the one-dimensional model cannot, such as lateral variations in seismic wave speed and amplification due to the basin’s irregular shape and varying depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Amplification Factor Calculated Through One-Dimensional Models (1D)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Amplification Factor Calculated Through two-Dimensional Models (2D)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Amplification Factor Calculated for the Tunja basin\n\n\n\nWhen I divide the results from the two-dimensional model by those from the one-dimensional model, I obtain the basin or topographic effect (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Basin-effect definition: 2D/1D\n\n\n\nTo effectively translate our seismic wave amplification findings into actionable guidelines for building codes, it became imperative to categorize the basin region according to its depth. This stratification is critical for tailoring construction standards that adequately reflect the varying seismic risks across different parts of the basin, as shown in Figure 5. In this specific analysis, I delineated the basin into two distinct zones based on depth: one encompassing areas of the basin above 55 kilometers and another for regions below this depth threshold.\nThis segmentation approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of seismic hazards, acknowledging that seismic amplification—and consequently, the potential for damage—varies significantly with depth. Areas above 55 kilometers may exhibit different seismic response characteristics compared to those below, impacting how structures within these zones should be designed and reinforced to withstand seismic events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Amplification Function due to Basin Effect for Two Depths of the Tunja Basin."
