The primary research focus was integrating models into seismic hazard, by using numerical simulations to account for site-specific effects. It was addressed by conducting two-dimensional simulations that analyzed the propagation of seismic waves through the ground and incorporating a non-linear constitutive model into QUAD4M, a FORTRAN software developed by researchers at the University of California, Davis.
