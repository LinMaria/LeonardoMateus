The primary research focus was integrating models into seismic hazard, by using numerical simulations to account for site-specific effects. It was addressed by conducting two-dimensional simulations that analyzed the propagation of seismic waves through the ground and incorporating a non-linear constitutive model into QUAD4M, a FORTRAN software developed by researchers at the University of California, Davis.

***Ongoing Projects***

-   [FutureForest
    (future-forest.eu)](https://future-forest.eu/ "Future Forest"): The
    aim of FutureForest is to use artificial intelligence (AI) methods
    to provide information that can support climate-adapted forest
    conversion. The effects of different climate forecasts and forest
    conversion scenarios are to be simulated and the possible effects of
    different management methods are to be assessed.
    Main tasks of FU Berlin include:
    -   Sentinel-2 time series based detection of forest damaged areas
        in Germany
    -   Operational \"near real-time\" monitoring using Deep Learning
        (DL)
    -   Early detection of damaged areas
    -   Provision of a Germany-wide map of current forest
        damage/warnings

-   UAV based analysis of the deciduous forests under drought stress in
    the historical garden districts of Berlin and Potsdam in 2020 (in
    cooperation with „Stiftung Preußische Schlösser & Gärten
    Berlin-Brandenburg" (SPSG) and „Grünflächenamt Berlin
    Steglitz-Zehlendorf"
