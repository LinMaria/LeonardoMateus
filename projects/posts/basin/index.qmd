The primary research focus was integrating models into seismic hazard, by using numerical simulations to account for site-specific effects. It was addressed by conducting two-dimensional simulations that analyzed the propagation of seismic waves through the ground and incorporating a non-linear constitutive model into QUAD4M, a FORTRAN software developed by researchers at the University of California, Davis.

***Iso-accelerations***

The results of our work are twofold: On @fig-basin, we highlight the sedimentary basin in gray, underscoring its complex structure and geological significance. On @fig-acc, we present iso-acceleration contours from our simulations, which identify areas within the basin at increased risk of seismic activity. This methodology not only advances our understanding of seismic wave behavior through complex geological formations but also aids in the precise identification of high-risk zones, contributing crucial data for seismic risk mitigation and urban planning in Tunja.

In our study, we've identified significant variations in the duration, amplitude, and frequency of seismic waves at nodes overlying sedimentary basins and topographic features, as shown in @fig-tempo.

The @fig-model1 and @fig-model2 offer a detailed visualization through colormaps of amplification versus structural period, utilizing a color spectrum where more intense shades of blue signify higher amplifications, contrasting sharply with yellows that indicate lower amplifications. On the left, we observe the amplification outcomes derived from a one-dimensional model, providing a foundational yet simplified understanding of seismic wave amplifications across the basin. In @fig-model1, the amplifications depicted are the result of employing more complex two-dimensional models, offering a nuanced and comprehensive portrayal of seismic behavior.

Key observations from these models include:

1. **Prominent Amplification in Basin's Deepest Zones**: Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional models converge on the insight that the most significant amplifications are observed near the deepest zones of the basin. This correlation underscores the critical role of basin depth in influencing seismic wave amplification, a vital consideration for seismic risk assessment.

2. **One-Dimensional Model Limitations**: The one-dimensional model, while valuable for initial analyses, exhibits inherent limitations in its capacity to fully replicate the intricate features of the basin's geology. This simplification results in a less accurate representation of how seismic waves interact with the basin's complex structure.

3. **Two-Dimensional Model's Detailed Capture**: In contrast, the two-dimensional model demonstrates a superior ability to accurately model and reflect the basin's detailed geological features. This model successfully captures variations in seismic behavior that the one-dimensional model cannot, such as lateral variations in seismic wave speed and amplification due to the basin's irregular shape and varying depth.

When I divide the results from the two-dimensional model by those from the one-dimensional model, I obtain the basin or topographic effect.

For practical purposes, and in order to incorporate these effects into building codes, it is necessary to divide the basin region based on its depth. For this specific case, I have segmented it into two distinct areas.
