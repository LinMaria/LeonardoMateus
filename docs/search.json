    "text": "Monitoring Farmland Abandonment by multitemporal and multisensor remote sensing imagery (MOFA)\n\nThe research project studies an area in the border region of Poland and Ukraine. With the fall of the Iron Curtain the region experienced drastic changes in political and socio- economic structures. Large farmland areas become abandoned and gradual processes of forest succession take place on the abandoned land. The aim of the project is the development of adequate strategies to monitor farmland abandonment, using multitemporal SAR and multispectral remote sensing data.\n\n\n\nFinally enhanced maps should be provided, which enable more detailed analysis of the gradual process of land cover transitions. (PI: B. Waske, funding: German Research Foundation (DFG) WA 2728/2-1)\nThus, remote sensing based mapping offers great opportunities to map these phenomena and ultimately to better understand patterns, processes and underlying causes. Existing studies are based on multispectral imagery, abandonment maps, however, are difficult to obtain due to spectral ambiguities, phenological variability and limited data availability. SAR data can overcome these problems and different remote sensing studies demonstrated the potential of multisensor imagery. The aim of the project is the development of adequate strategies to monitor farmland abandonment, using multitemporal SAR and multispectral remote sensing data. Finally enhanced maps should be provided, which enable more detailed analysis of the gradual process of land cover transitions.\nThe study site within the border region of Poland and Ukraine (© Google, 2012)\n\n\nProject Duration: 01/2012 - 12/2014\nPrincipal Investigator: Björn Waske\nProjects staff: Jan Stefanski (University Bonn)\nProject partners:\nProf. Dr. Tobias Kümmerle, Biogeography and Conservation Biology Group, Humboldt-University of Berlin\nDr. Oleh Chaskovskyy, Ukrainian National Forestry University, Lviv (Ukraine)\nDr. hab.

    "text": "Calibrating the model is essential for ensuring its reliability. A close correspondence between the modeled results and actual earthquake measurements validates the model’s accuracy. Below is another numerical model from Pereira, Colombia, where the impact of topography on amplification is clearly visible. Most importantly, this example underscores the precision of the two-dimensional model in capturing these effects.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Geological profile of the Tunja basin\n\n\nPERC1, PERC2, and PERC3 are accelerometer stations located on varying topographies. Each figure presented includes four lines representing different aspects of seismic data analysis:\n\nReg-Boca-Roca (gray line) illustrates the actual signal recorded over rock ( Vs &gt; 760 m/s), which was used as the input signal\nMod NL 1D (red line) illustrates the response spectrum generated by a one-dimensional model.\nMod 2D (green line) illustrates the response spectrum generated by a two-dimensional model.\nRecord (black line) illustrates the response spectrum from a real earthquake event\n\nI conducted several two-dimensional models across a range of intensities, selecting multiple points on the surface to compute curvature and slope from a digital elevation model. These calculations were then correlated with amplifications, enabling me to establish functional relationships. These relationships illustrate how terrain characteristics influence amplification effects for specific spectrum periods (PGA, 0.2 s, 1.0 s).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Geological profile of the Tunja basin\n\n\nAbove, we observe transfer functions corresponding to each combination of slope and curvature. It’s evident that a curvature of zero results in an amplification equal to zero. Positive curvatures represent crests, leading to amplifications, while negative curvatures are indicative of valleys, resulting in deamplifications.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Geological profile of the Tunja basin\n\n\nWhen I applied those functions, I generated the following map, which proves invaluable for incorporation into building codes.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Geological profile of the Tunja basin"

    "text": "The primary research focus was integrating models into seismic hazard, by using numerical simulations to account for site-specific effects. It was addressed by conducting two-dimensional simulations that analyzed the propagation of seismic waves through the ground and incorporating a non-linear constitutive model into QUAD4M, a FORTRAN software developed by researchers at the University of California, Davis.\nIso-accelerations\nThe results of our work are twofold: On Figure 2 (a), we highlight the sedimentary basin in gray, underscoring its complex structure and geological significance. On Figure 2 (b), we present iso-acceleration contours from our simulations, which identify areas within the basin at increased risk of seismic activity. This methodology not only advances our understanding of seismic wave behavior through complex geological formations but also aids in the precise identification of high-risk zones, contributing crucial data for seismic risk mitigation and urban planning in Tunja.\n\nFigure 1: Modeling results for the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Geological profile of the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Iso-aceleration values in the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have observed changes in the duration, amplitude, and frequency of nodes located over sedimentary basins and topographic features.\n The following figures display colormaps of amplifications versus structural periodo. More intense blue indicates higher amplifications, in contrast to yellow, which signifies lower amplifications. On the left, the colormap represents amplifications resulting from a one-dimensional model. On the right, the amplifications are a consequence of using two-dimensional models. We can see:\n\nBoth models illustrate that the greatest amplifications occur close to the deepest zones of the basin\nIt is evident that the one-dimensional model cannot replicate certain features in the basin, whereas the two-dimensional model successfully captures these details\n\n\nFigure 2: Modeling results for the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Geological profile of the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Iso-aceleration values in the Tunja basin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I divide the results from the two-dimensional model by those from the one-dimensional model, I obtain the basin or topographic effect.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Iso-aceleration values in the Tunja basin\n\n\nFor practical purposes, and in order to incorporate these effects into building codes, it is necessary to divide the basin region based on its depth. For this specific case, I have segmented it into two distinct areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Iso-aceleration v"
