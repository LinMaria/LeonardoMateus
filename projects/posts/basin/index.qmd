The primary research focus was integrating models into seismic hazard, by using numerical simulations to account for site-specific effects. It was addressed by conducting two-dimensional simulations that analyzed the propagation of seismic waves through the ground and incorporating a non-linear constitutive model into QUAD4M, a FORTRAN software developed by researchers at the University of California, Davis.

***Iso-accelerations***

The results of our work are twofold: On @fig-basin, we highlight the sedimentary basin in gray, underscoring its complex structure and geological significance. On @fig-acc, we present iso-acceleration contours from our simulations, which identify areas within the basin at increased risk of seismic activity. This methodology not only advances our understanding of seismic wave behavior through complex geological formations but also aids in the precise identification of high-risk zones, contributing crucial data for seismic risk mitigation and urban planning in Tunja.

We have observed changes in the duration, amplitude, and frequency of nodes located over sedimentary basins and topographic features.

The following figures display colormaps of amplifications versus structural periodo. More intense blue indicates higher amplifications, in contrast to yellow, which signifies lower  amplifications. On the left, the colormap represents amplifications resulting from a one-dimensional model. On the right, the amplifications are a consequence of using two-dimensional models. We can see:

- Both models illustrate that the greatest amplifications occur close to the deepest zones of the basin 

- It is evident that the one-dimensional model cannot replicate certain features in the basin, whereas the two-dimensional model successfully captures these details

When I divide the results from the two-dimensional model by those from the one-dimensional model, I obtain the basin or topographic effect.

For practical purposes, and in order to incorporate these effects into building codes, it is necessary to divide the basin region based on its depth. For this specific case, I have segmented it into two distinct areas.
