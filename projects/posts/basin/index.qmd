The primary research focus was integrating models into seismic hazard, by using numerical simulations to account for site-specific effects. It was addressed by conducting two-dimensional simulations that analyzed the propagation of seismic waves through the ground and incorporating a non-linear constitutive model into QUAD4M, a FORTRAN software developed by researchers at the University of California, Davis.

***Iso-accelerations***

The results of our work are twofold: On @fig-basin, we highlight the sedimentary basin in gray, underscoring its complex structure and geological significance. On @fig-acc, we present iso-acceleration contours from our simulations, which identify areas within the basin at increased risk of seismic activity. This methodology not only advances our understanding of seismic wave behavior through complex geological formations but also aids in the precise identification of high-risk zones, contributing crucial data for seismic risk mitigation and urban planning in Tunja.
